# Test Task (Borys Melnychuk)

My solution could be explained like that: I will use pretrained PyTorch Unet model with encoder of ResNet34 which will be finetuned using Airbus Ship Dataset.

Structure of the project:
- `loaders.py` ()
- `losses.py` ()
- `main.py` ()
- `metrics.py` ()
- `requirements.txt` ()
- `ShipDataset.py` ()
- `utils.py` ()
- `pytorch-unet.ipynb` ()

How to run `main.py`
